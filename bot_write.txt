# ðŸ“š **Welcome to the server!** ðŸŽ“

Hello everyone! Hereâ€™s a quick guide on how to verify on our server.

---

### 1. **Three key commands**
- **/verify** â€“ Verify your school email address.
- **/verify_code** â€“ Enter the code sent to your school email.
- **/strip** â€“ Use this if you have verification issues or entered the wrong email.

### 2. **For VUT students**
If you are a VUT student, follow these steps:

1. In #jail use the command **/verify id@vutbr.cz** (donâ€™t forget your six-digit school email ID).
2. A confirmation code will be sent to your school **Outlook email**.
3. Use the command **/verify_code ABCDEF** (where "ABCDEF" is your code) to verify.
4. After successful verification, you will receive the **VUT** role.
5. You can then select subject rooms in **#add-subject** and your faculty in **#VUT-role** (for better organization, currently all students have the same permissions).

### 3. **For prospective students or guests**
If you are not a VUT student but want to join as a guest, follow the same steps:

1. In #jail use the **/verify** command with your regular email (Gmail, Outlook, etc.).
2. You will receive a confirmation code to your email.
3. Use the command **/verify_code ABCDEF** to verify.
4. You will receive the **guest** role and wonâ€™t have access to subject rooms, but you will have access to **#general** and **#offtopic**.

### 4. **Verification issues?**
If you have any issues with verification or entered the wrong email, use the **/strip** command to start over.

If you still have problems, please write in **#jail** about your issue and tag a moderator. They will either help you directly in the channel or message you privately.
